# BucketList

This is project 14 of 100 Days of SwiftUI by Paul Hudson (link [here](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/books/ios-swiftui/bucket-list-introduction)). The project is an app that lets the user build a private list of places on the map that they intend to visit one day, add a description for that place, look up interesting places that are nearby, and save it all to the iOS storage for later.

As usual, at the end of the guided tutorial there will be three challenges for me to implement by myself.
